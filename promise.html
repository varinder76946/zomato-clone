    <!-- Promise
    when we promise of doing a thing (like homework on time) there are two possibilities which can happen . first is I will do the homework 
    which is promise complete, second is promise reject I will not do home work.

    so in coding promise is the promise that this below code will run for sure. wheather it's a succes or failure. but code will run.
    promise give a surity that code will run. wheather it's success or failure. but code will run ...

    if i made a fucntion that fetch movies using promises so two things will happen it fetch the movies or not able to fetch. 
    but function tried to react there..... this is promise.

    <!-- // Promise: Best video on promises
// -resolve
// -reject
// -pending -->

<script>
                        // this is the callback function...
function func1() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { // here function promise to run the set of code that there are two possiblities
        // after running the code. one is resolve and reject. but function promise to resolve. if not then it will reject.
        setTimeout(() => {
            const error = true;
            if (!error) {
                console.log('Function: Your promise has been resolved')
                resolve();
            }
            else {
                console.log('Function: Your promise has not been resolved')
                reject('Sorry not fulfilled');
            }
        }, 2000);
    })
}

func1().then(function(){ //here then is used if fucntion is resolved .. if function is resolved it will perform below statement.
    console.log("Harry: Thanks for resolving")
}).catch(function(error){ // here if function doesn't resolve it will be catch here and throw the error ..  
    console.log("Harry: Very bad bro. Reason: " + error)
})

// why we use promises = promise give us all the predictions that code will be run task will be resolve and if it resolved then 
// we will use .then method to perform a task if it got resolved,   
// but if it doesn't resolve then it will throw a error . we use .catch to catch the failure. 

// so if we dont use promises if our code is a failure. it will not gonna throw the error.and user will be blank like what happened
// but using promises we can reach both possiblities . if function resolve we will use .then method to perform a tast.if it doesnt
// we gonna catch the error and do a task on failure or give it to the user now user have something answer that why it doesnt resolve
